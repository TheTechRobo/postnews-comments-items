This is the new system for claiming chunks.

To claim a chunk, move it from the UNCLAIMED directory to the CLAIMED directory. Please PM me with your GitHub username so I can give you push access.

You can do this either by cloning the git repo onto your computer or by going onto a chunk, clicking the edit button, moving your cursor to the start of the filename input box, and typing `../CLAIMED/<yourusername>`.
